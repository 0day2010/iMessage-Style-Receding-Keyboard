iMessage Style Receding Keyboard
======================================================================

*Caveat: this has not been put in production code. Apple may deny this.*

This is a working implementation of how you can create iMessage style receding keyboards by grabbing the keyboard through the view hierarchy and dragging it around. Originally started from this stack overflow question [iMessage Style Receding Keyboard in an iOS App](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7780753/imessage-style-receding-keyboard-in-an-ios-app) it was eventually turned into a blog post on my [website](http://orta.github.com/code/imessage-style-receding-keyboards-in-uikit/), and finally this repository.
